## NFT Minting Solution
This is a small personal project; it demonstrates a simple implementation of Web3JS without the use of any frameworks such as React or NuxtJSm running alone in the browser. This project contains code that will: randomly generate an nft, mint the nft on the ethereum block chain as well as a Solidity Smart contract which works with the frontend.
